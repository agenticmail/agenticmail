# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a welcoming experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size,
visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards
of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action
in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, including the GitHub
repository, issue tracker, pull requests, discussions, and any other channel
used for project communication.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/agenticmail/agenticmail/issues) or by
contacting the project maintainer directly via
[GitHub](https://github.com/ope-olatunji).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project
team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.
