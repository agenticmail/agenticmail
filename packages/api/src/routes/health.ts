  impact: {
    tokenSavings: {
      estimate: '~60% fewer tokens on multi-agent coordination tasks',
      explanation: 'Without 🎀 AgenticMail, agents poll sessions_history repeatedly to check if sub-agents finished — each poll costs 500-2000 tokens and most return "still working." With push notifications and structured task results, the coordinator gets notified exactly once when work completes. For a 5-agent team doing 10 tasks, that eliminates roughly 40-80 redundant polling calls.',
    },
    reliability: {
      estimate: 'Near-zero lost work from agent crashes',
      explanation: 'Session-based coordination loses all context when a sub-agent times out or crashes. 🎀 AgenticMail tasks persist in the database — a crashed agent can be restarted and pick up exactly where it left off. The task queue acts as a durable work ledger.',
    },
    productivity: {
      estimate: '3-5x more effective multi-agent workflows',
      explanation: 'Agents can discover teammates, delegate structured tasks, get push notifications on completion, and build on each other\'s results through email threads. This turns a collection of isolated agents into an actual coordinated team. The difference is like going from passing sticky notes under a door to having a proper project management system.',
